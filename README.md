The analysis focused on school performance of a fictional , PyCity Schools, based on various factors, including spending per student, school size, and school type.
Databases were created for each category.
School Performance by Spending Per Student:
Schools were categorized into spending ranges per student using bins.
Average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall passing, were calculated for each spending range. 
Generally, schools with lower spending per student tended to have higher average scores and passing rates compared to those with higher spending.
School Performance by School Size:
Schools were grouped into small, medium, and large bins based on the total number of students.
Average math and reading scores, along with the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall passing, were calculated for each school size category.
Small and medium-sized schools tended to have higher average scores and passing rates compared to large schools.
School Performance by School Type:
Schools were grouped into "Charter" and "District" types.  A tutor helped me with creating this database as I was getting a value error for overall passing rates in the district summary. The solution was to list each school and type rather than finding the two types of schools in the data.
Average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall passing, were calculated for each school type.
Charter schools outperformed district schools in terms of average scores and passing rates as they had the top five passing rates in the city. The bottom five schools were district schools. 
I concluded there is a trend indicating that lower spending per student, smaller school sizes, and charter school types are associated with higher academic performance and passing rates.
